So a Printer to the Society‚ was an Officer that appearedz

necessary at the time when the statutos concerning that office , ·

were established: but the affairs of Priuting and Bookselling,
are so greatly altered sance the 'institution of the Society‚ that
Printers and Booksellers have for many years stood in no other·

relation to the Royal Society than any other Tradesrnen they ·

employ; and particularly, fines the Transaelions have been ’
printed under their own care. They themselves now buyand
pay for the paper3 employ and pay the Priuters and En·
gravers3 ⁴corre& and publilh their own Works; and finally
dispose osto Purehasers the surplus copies, above the number*
distributed amongst their· Members by their own librarian. ,

Thus much seemed proper to be premised‚ in order to lhewt
the grounds and reasons of the alterations now made.
